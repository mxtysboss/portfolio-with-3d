# My Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio, which you can visit at [mati.trakz.pl](https://mati.trakz.pl).  
The site is designed with modern aesthetics, animations, and interactivity in mind.

## Technologies

- **React** – for building the entire application and components.
- **GSAP** – for smooth animations and transitions.
- **Three.js** – to animate a 3D object in the **About Me** section while scrolling.

## Features

- **About Me Section** – interactive 3D object reacting to scroll.
- **Responsive Design** – looks great on any device.
- **Smooth Animations** – all transitions and effects are natural and visually pleasing thanks to GSAP.
